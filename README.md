Processing for Haskell
=============================================

Computer Graphics for kids and artists! The library implements
Processing language in Haskell.

Welll, But actually it...

... implemets a **subset** of Processing Language in Haskell. So ...


The project needs your help
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Processing being a small language implements some  tons of
magic with OpenGL  under the hood. There are really big implementations
of graphics primitives. I can not finish this thing all alone.
So I you are really interested in seing the package finished.
If you want all features of Processing be implemented please **do** contribute!


Guide 
-----------------------------------

Cool description that makes it clear how to create wonderful animations with the library.

**TODO**
